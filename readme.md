# Generalized AI Research

This Class allows one to instantiate a vector to:
- create vectors from features
- access basic descriptive statistics and machine learning algorithms
- in dev- a [second try at a generalized ai model](https://github.com/kyle1james/teachAiToFeelSpring2022) 


### Dev Cycles

Using G-Tech's OMSCS courses to help with the following tasks:

| Course      | Project | Reason|
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------|
| Ed-Tech      | Predictions of educational oppression | always more math & love
| NLP   | Text-Analysis of UFO Reports-Trends in self reported data       | learn nlp 
| Ubiquitous Computing| What Does My Dog Want     | AI must learn to Love


### Goal
The Generalized model will be used with a RPi Flask server, enabling a mobile robot to form assumptions, beliefs, and feelings towards an individual. You may find the robot server template under the Robot folder. Waiting for LIDAR sensor.
